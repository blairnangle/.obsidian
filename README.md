# .obsidian

Version-controlled config files for my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vaults.

## Installation

- Clone this repository locally
- Symlink the local clone's contents to identically named files within an `.obsidian` dir in the new Obsidian
  vault using the `symlink.sh` script. E.g.,

  ```shell
  ./symlink.sh "/Users/blairnangle/personal/.obsidian/" "/Users/blairnangle/personal/brain/content/.obsidian/"
  ```

- Restart the Obsidian macOS app (if it was open)
